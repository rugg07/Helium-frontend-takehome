  // Generates intelligent suggestions
  generateSuggestions(patterns, gaps, phase): ComponentSuggestion[]
}
```

**Key Capabilities**:

- Suggestion ranking and deduplication
- Learning from user interactions

#### 2. Natural Language Bridge

**Multi-step Wizard Process**:
1. **Component Type Selection** - Choose from predefined categories
2. **Purpose Definition** - Free-text description of functionality
3. **Visual Style Selection** - Multi-select style preferences
4. **Interaction Requirements** - Select desired interactions
5. **Complexity Level** - Range slider for complexity preference
